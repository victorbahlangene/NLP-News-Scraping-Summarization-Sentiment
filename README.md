# NLP-News-Scraping-Summarization-Sentiment

**News Scraping Summarization Sentiment**

I will be using 2 different types of transformers for this project. One for Summarization text and another Sentiment analysis.

### `Introduction: Business Problem`

As someone new to the data science world, I find it hard at time to keep track of the various cutting edge technologies within our ever growing field.

A great way to keep track of the technology is to read articles on medium. The question then becomes where to start.

This project is designed for a user to enter a technology(in this case a framework) so as to find out the latest articles about this technology. Then I will summarize this article so as to make choosing an article to read to be easier when you have an idea what the article contains. Then I will perform Sentiment analysis to determine if the article is positive or negative. Finally export the data as a .csv(comma separated values) file for the user.

### `Methodology`

The project will be executed by completing the following tasks:

1. Install and Import Baseline Dependencies
2. Setup Summarization Model
3. Building a news summarization and sentiment Pipeline
4. Export Results to CSV.
